Move reallyFinal/Final texts to Current; check in to repo
Run divFixes.xsl over the texts containing div type=incipit to remove same
check in; error count now done to 40/50

Notice there are still some lowercase4 filenames, and consequent brouhaha.
Hand fix what can be hand-fixed quickly: commit 10e573c0909e0ef200d0ffdfe7f2f5cb6b944e87 .
,

About 40 files had TEI with invalid xml:ids (not taken from filename, but duplicate "T100") the same files had invalid idno and often invalid meeting info. Fixed by hand in Current: also fixed 8 texts with @type="-v"; this all needs to be systematically checked (see below)

A few other trivial syntax errors fixed. Now valid against TEI All.


-----------------
Now checking conformance against difdepo.rnc

T10010306-1987-06 has a CR and an OJ, but they seem to be both parts of the same CR to me. The attendance list is in the OJ not the CR. 

1. note/@resp was missing from schema. Added. OTOH there are loads of notes which just say "$$$$" 

2. Attribute @style not present in schema. Used in 19 <p> elements for e.g. alignment of text. Added pro tem, but I think it shd be thrown away.
@style is used on hi and seg once wrongly for U+221E (T10010166-1974-08-CV). Removed.
seg is used 8 times, 5 times with @rend='superscript', three times with @rend='color'. Turn them all to <hi>
hi is used 227+8 times, typically for superscripts.

3. table is used, frequently, in T10010168-1974-11-CR but not elsewhere. Commented out this file for the moment.

4. g is used 11 times for a small number of wingdings. needs to be checked and transformed.

wingdings used: 
	  CD U+1F655 leaf stop
	  DF U+1F868 left arrow
	  E0 U+1F86A right arrow

fixed with gFixes.xsl 

5. choice is used twice. removed both but left comment

6. 0J is not the same as OJ (corrected T10010214-1979-03-OJ)

7 Who is Dominique Roussillon? removed him from T10010215-1979-04-CR anyway

8 docx conv failure for T10010225-1980-02-CV

9 incorrectly structured bibl for T10010324-1989-02-CR (fixed, but will fail check for meaningful attendance list)

10 T10010292-1986-04-CR : sole occurrence of <quote> : removed

 then ran checkups.xsl over each file to determine whether identifiers were correct, with the following results:
